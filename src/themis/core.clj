;; Themis
;; ---------
;;
;; ### Why another validation library?
;;
;; 1. The validation rule set should be expressed as data.
;;    Rule sets should be able to completely serialize to EDN.
;; 2. Validators should always resolve to something that supports IFn.
;;    The resolution of data to IFn-ables happens at validation time.
;; 3. Applying validation should be nothing more than applying functions
;;    and seq'ing the results together.
;; 4. Validation is often domain specific, and the library should be open
;;    for modification to adapt easily to different requirements.
;; 5. Validation results should not be conj'd/merge'd onto the original data
;;    (unless the user specifically did that).
;; 6. Validation rule sets should allow for proper namespacing of
;;    validators (symbols/functions/etc) and general data.
;;
;; ### Assumptions and expectations
;;
;; Themis attempts to make no assumptions about the data structure you're
;; validating, the results your validator functions return, or how
;; you want to package up the results of a full `validation`.
;;
;; When assumptions are made, there is always an escape hatch allowing
;; you to modify the behavior to better suit your application needs.
;;
;; ### Why the name `Themis`?
;;
;; I was originally using `metis`, a validation library named after Zeus'
;; first wife.  So, I naturally named mine after Zeus' second wife.
;;
;; ### Ideal usage
;;
;; See the comment block below, but `(validation my-ds ds-rule-vec)`
